This is an online library that I created to test and further cement my knowledge
with object constructors within Javascript. Self admittadly, this was a tough one for a bit
when it came to the logic for appending the user input to the html. I'm still not fully satisfied
with the final code as I believe I can make it more efficient/less verbose, but as of now, there is a 
final product.
